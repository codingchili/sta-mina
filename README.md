# sta-mina
minimal static site generator. status: in development.

![preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codingchili/sta-mina/master/preview.webp "Current snapshot version")

Sample using the first template and a template rendered with template literals + a json file to hold the template data.

Two modes of rendering, update the existing body or overwrite the current document.

- overwrite: full support for styling but issues with flashing screen.
- update: causes some minor CSS issues but does not cause any screen flashing when loading.


TBD
- a wrapper for sed and zip to set the template URL and data URL and then zip the project.
